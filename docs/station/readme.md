## 1 About

This is an add-on to the China Set: Stations and Platforms set, providing additional station buildings.

## 2 General information

### 2.1 Requirements

- OpenTTD 14.0 or higher
    * There are also some features such as railway waypoint classes and road stop waypoints, that are only enabled for OpenTTD 15.0 or higher.
    * A legacy mode has been implemented for older versions of OpenTTD. Tested with OpenTTD 12.0 and should work with anything above 10.0. The number of available stations is vastly reduced in this mode though.
- Not compatible with TTDPatch

### 2.2 Installation

OpenTTD:
see https://wiki.openttd.org/NewGRF
  
This NewGRF is available from the in-game Online Content. You can also download the releases from Github Releases at https://github.com/ahyangyi/openttd-newgrfs/releases/.

## 3 Design Philosophy

This NewGRF is designed with the following player types in mind.

**Effie** is the efficiency-oriented player. She likes to build the most efficient transportation network for the given scenario.

**Cindy** is the eye-candy player. She treats the game as a canvas for her artistic inspirations.

**Rei** is the realism player. She goes into details. She creates a timetable for each route, systematically numbers and labels her trains, and places her stations to reflect her grand plan.
