China Set: Stations & Platforms Addons: Wuhu Changelog
=========================

------------------------
Add the 1934 Wuhu Station.

0.2.2 (2024-06-14)
--------------------
Further fix for the climate-aware groundsprites: they didn't work with custom track NewGRFs.

Add parameter to control station introduction years.

0.2.1 (2024-06-02)
--------------------
Fix monorail and maglev graphics (broken by the climate-aware groundsprite).

0.2.0 (2024-05-31)
--------------------
Redesign graphics, now the station building is always built atop a concrete platform. Corresponding tiles ("concourse") are also made buildable.

Switch platform/shelter graphics to the new ones from China Set: Stations; support all existing combinations.

Rework templates, now it is guaranteed that any rectangle-shaped subset of a template also has a coherent look-and-feel, and the existence of any platform is remembered during such (de)construction.

Make groundsprites climate aware: now desert and snow tiles show the respective ground type correctly.

--------------------
Fix traversability of fully-traversable templates.
