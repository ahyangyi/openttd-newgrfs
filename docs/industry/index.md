# AEGIS - Ahyangyi's Extended Generic Industry Set
AEGIS is a modular industry set with options to support various playstyles.

There are already many NewGRFs available. I think they can be roughly divided into two kinds: *thematic* and *mechanic* ones.
The *thematic* ones, championed by FIRS and perhaps the various “national” industry sets, use a top-down approach: they have a theme, a look-and-feel about the industry first, and fill out the mechanics later. The *mechanical* ones, exemplified by YETI and all of the 2TallTyler industry sets, usually start from *gameplay* ideas, and build the other parts of the NewGRF with a buttom-up approach.

AEGIS attempts to provide a compromise between the two styles: by being modular, it offers both new themes and new mechanics, and allows a free mix-and-match approach. The presets are designed to make it easy to recreate the basic mechanism of many existing NewGRF sets, and apply them to different thematic economies. The parameters are designed to be as orthogonal as possible.
